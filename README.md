## Fundamentals of Data Analysis Pratical Assignment
## An Analysis of Anscombe's quartet dataset 

### The programming Language used to assist in writing code for this project is Python
Anaconda download is a great way to install Python and all of the common Python libraries on your computer. I recommend installing version 3.6, 64-bit. https://www.python.org/.
## Problem Statement
## The following assignment concerns the Analysis of the well-known Anscombe's quartet dataset
Anscombe's quartet comprises four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, yet appear very different when graphed. Each dataset consists of eleven (x,y) points. They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe to demonstrate both the importance of graphing data before analyzing it and the effect of outliers on statistical properties. He described the article as being intended to counter the impression among statisticians that "numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough.

First of all, I have created a Jupyter Notebook analysing the dataset

There are four distinct tasks in which I carried out in my Jupyter Notebook, as follows

1.An explanation to the background of the dataset - who createdit, when it was created, and any speculations I found regarding how it might       have been created.

2.I have plotted, the interesting aspects that I found about the dataset

3.I have calculated the descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset

4.An explanation as to why, the dataset is interesting, making reference to the plots I have created and the calculations I have performed
